This is my first README Generator in Bootcamp using Node.js.

This README Generator allows the user to:

Create a command-line application that accepts the user's input.

When a user is prompted for information about the application repository, a high-quality, professional README.md is generated.

Generates the user's title of the project, sections entitled, description, and table of contents.

When a user enters the project title, it's displayed as the title of the README.

When a user enters a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions, this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.

When a user chooses a license for their application from a list of options, a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.

When a user enters their GitHub username, it's added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to their GitHub profile.

When a user enters their email address, it's added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach them with additional questions.

When a user clicks on the links in the Table of Contents, they are taken to the corresponding section of the README.
